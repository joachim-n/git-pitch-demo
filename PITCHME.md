# One

---

@transition[none]

# Two

I want this slide to have no transition into the one that follows.
However, it also gets a mix of fade/nothing from slide One.


---

# Three

@transition[none]

The transition[none] appears to be necessary in both slides either side of a
transition.

---

# Four

This also gets a mix of fade and none transition effects.
